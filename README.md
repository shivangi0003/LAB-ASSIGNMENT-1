## Professional Web Portfolio
## Overview
This is a clean, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects. The design prioritizes readability, user experience (UX), and a professional aesthetic using a strong blue color palette (#0044cc).

The CSS provided defines a visually appealing structure with interactive elements, ensuring a consistent and engaging presentation across all screen sizes.

## Key Features & Styles
The CSS file implements several key design principles and features:

1. Modern and Clean Layout
Color Scheme: Dominantly uses a deep professional blue (#0044cc) for headers, borders, and main calls-to-action, contrasted with white backgrounds and a light grey page background (#f4f4f4).

Typography: Uses a standard, highly readable Arial, sans-serif font.

Structure: Sections are clearly defined with ample padding, a maximum width of 800px, and a subtle box-shadow for visual separation and depth.

## 2. Interactive Project Cards
The .project class defines dedicated cards for each project.

Hover Effects: Projects feature a smooth transition for interactive feedback. On hover (.project-link:hover .project), the card scales up slightly (transform: scale(1.03)), changes its background color, and receives a stronger, blue-tinted shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 68, 204, 0.3)).

Active State: The :active state provides instant feedback by scaling the card down (transform: scale(0.98)) when clicked.

## 3. Responsive Form Styling
The form is centered and set to 60% width (which would be responsive on smaller screens).

Form elements (input, textarea) have a 100% width, full padding, and a strong blue border, making them clear and easy to interact with.

The "Send Message" button is styled as a primary action button with a hover effect.

### 4. Table Styling
The Technical Skills table is visually clear and professional, with a 60% width and blue borders.

The table header (th) uses the primary blue color for a bold and legible contrast.

## Technologies Used
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for all presentation and layout logic.

HTML5 (Structure): (Implied by the CSS selectors) Provides the semantic structure for the portfolio content.
